# Couch To 5k - Fitbit App

I created this as I didnt like having to run with headphones on, and the narrators on the podcast have a habit of shouting from my pocket every time I run past someone (awkward trying to explain it was Sarah Millican and not me doing a silly voice!)

Select a week by swiping on your fitbit (only OG fitbits supported at present - versa 1/2 etc) screen. Click the run you wish to do and it will start. The watch will vibrate when you have to change from run to walk etc.

Currently it cant save your progress, but I would like to add this in the future. I would also like to add timers so you can see how much longer you have to run, and monitor your heart rate as well.
Additionally, I would also like to add the ability to ... do something that has slipped my mind since I started writing this sentence - its been a long day and I am now writing documentation for a project that I am 99% sure only I will ever use!
